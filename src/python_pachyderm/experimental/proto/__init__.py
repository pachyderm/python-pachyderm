"""
These protos have been generated with the open-source library betterproto 
(https://github.com/danielgtaylor/python-betterproto) rather than the google 
protobuf library. These protos are more pythonic and easier to work with than
the google-generated protos.

To create a proto object, import the relevant module from
:class:`.python_pachyderm.experimental.service`
(i.e. ``from python_pachyderm.experimental.service import pfs_proto, auth_proto``)
For using the docs to create the proto object, **we recommend clicking the
"[source]" button to better see each class' members**. The documentation
generator doesn't handle these dataclass objects well.
